# The Iron Yard -- Orlando Student Roster

It's not just a directory of trivia, it's also a practice problem!

## To play this game...

1. Fork this project.
2. Add a file for yourself...
  * find the correct `TEMPLATE.md` file for your cohort, e.g. [`2015-01/TEMPLATE.md`](2015-01/TEMPLATE.md)
  * copy the contents into a file named `USERNAME.md` where `USERNAME` is your Github username
  * add and commit that file into the appropriate directory for your cohort, e.g. [`2015-01/FEE/al-the-x.md`](2015-01/FEE/al-the-x.md), [`2015-01/ROR/bgates.md`](2015-01/ROR/bgates.md)
3. [Open a Pull Request (PR](https://github.com/TheIronYard--Orlando/student-roster/pulls) to `master`
4. Get your PR merged...
  * maybe @-mention your instructor in the description?
  * drop a link to the PR in HipChat?
  * compose an interpretive dance to perform at standup?

## Congrats! Now what?

Your instructor will give you weekly assignments to fill out the information for your cohort based on the `TEMPLATE.md` file. You'll need to `git pull` regularly in a local clone to get the latest commits from your fellow students, and open additional PRs to add your own. Over time, we'll `git` to know one another... :tomato:
